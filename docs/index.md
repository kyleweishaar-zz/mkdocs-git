# Moving to Git

Welcome to the learning portal for working with Git as a source control for our Flare documentation.

## About

We designed this website and its content to simplify the learning process of moving to git. Git is not too difficult to learn, but it is very powerful, and it offers us a lot of options in how we manage our source documentation.

We developed the topics on this site by going through different working scenarios while documenting our progress. You can use git via the command line or with a GUI. We recommend that you learn how to use Git Extension, which provides most of the functionality you will need for your daily work.

For basic git functions, you'll find topics written for Git Extension and for Git Bash.

## For new writers

As a new writer, you'll need to access to our github repositories. You'll find these instructions
[here](https://confluence.qliktech.com/display/QE/How+to+get+access+to+the+Qlik+repositories+on+GitHub).
